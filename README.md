# Notes on growthcurves_frontend

This is the nascent streamlit app that will act as the frontend of code by David Talmy and Spiro Papoulis to fit models to bacterial growth curves.

To run: I'm using a virtualenv managed by conda with python 3.7.3. 

Before running, I need to run `conda activate growthcurves_frontend`. 

To install modules, I need to use `~/anaconda/envs/growthcurves_frontend/bin/pip install`
